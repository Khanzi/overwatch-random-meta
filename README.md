# Random Overwatch

This little python script will generate a variety of different team compositions for you and your buddies while you guys play Overwatch. Now Tyler won't get stuck playing Mercy for 3 hours straight and every gets a chance to play different roles and heroes.
Recently developed it into a Discord bot.

## Future Improvements
* Allows members to set preferences
* Better exception handling
* Commands are nicely categorized

## Invite 
[Here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=472403679475925003&scope=bot) is the link so you can crash my computer by spamming the test bot

## Donations and Suggestions
This bot is currently running on my own server. It costs money to host but the benefits will be felt worldwide by everyone using the bot.
If you can please donate -  all donations go directly to paying for hosting and coffee
